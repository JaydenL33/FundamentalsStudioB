Confirmed cases include presumptive positive cases.

Recovered cases outside China are estimates based on local media reports, and may be substantially lower than the true number.

Active cases = total confirmed - total recovered - total deaths.

Incidence Rate = confirmed cases per 100,000 persons.

Case-Fatality Ratio (%) = Number recorded deaths / Number confirmed cases.

US Testing Rate = total tested per 100,000 persons.

US Hospitalization Rate (%) = Total number hospitalized / Number confirmed cases.
