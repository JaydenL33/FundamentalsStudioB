The Development Process
=======================

This section describes the details of our development process. GitHub,
LabArchives, team meetings, etc. should all be mentioned here.

Development process.
The development process group SANITISE agreed on the agile development methods. The agile development method allows for an iterative process where requirements and potential solutions that evolve throughout the project, as the scope becomes clearer as the project progresses. 

To facilitate this development method our team has used several tools collectively and individually to effectively manage team progress. The following tools include Microsoft teams; for team communication and ideas management and generation, GitHub; for collective and effective development of code and the project, and lastly lab archives for the individual logging of activities and ideas.
