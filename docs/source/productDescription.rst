Product Description and Context
-------------------------------

Given the current situation regarding SARS-CoV-2, we conferred and agreed that there was a lacking in centralised and relevant information for the general public. Currently, the
closest products with similar goals are:

* ArcGis Dashboard (CSSE at John Hopkins University 2020);
* NSW Daily Telegraph live-page (Carayannis 2020);
* World Meter (World Meter 2020);
* Tokyo CDC Reporting (Tokyo Metropolitan Government 2020);
* 1Point3Acres (1Point3Acres 2020);
* WHO Dashboard/Explorer (WHO 2020).


Looking at these above mention similar commercial and educational products, particularly the “COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU)” and the “COVID-19 World Meter” it is clear that what these existing solution goal is to present in the simplest form the geographical spread of Covid-19 and its level of abundance in the world. Thus, it is clear that these solutions although mainly just present figures without context that it aim is to provide simply a statistical overview on the current situation of the pandemic and either through its presentation of data evoke a response to encourage those to take precautions and acknowledge the pandemic seriously as the virus is highly transmissible.

However, these existing solutions  miss the vital aim of our product, in essence, it must relevantly compare and visualise the complex and dynamic data of the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak promptly that helps enable well-informed and update predictions based on the latest data available for the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. 
SANITISE.media comprises of two main components, a data-plane service for modelling and managing the data and a front-end service to meet accessibility requirements. 

This project will possibly include scope extension(s) to include modularity to more viruses. Further, it will likely extend to further views and data interpolation. 
Following is a breakdown of the methodology and systems proposed for development as introduced above.

Models and Views
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The basis of these models and views derives from the developing research over the time frame of this project. These models and views are “not set in stone”, and their alteration
may occur (several times perhaps) over the time frame of our project. However, the ideas presented in this proposal will outline the keys aspects that are fundamental to our product aims.
This model outline follows due to the fundamental nature of SARS-CoV-2 and the ever-changing advice and research on the situation. From the research we have available, we will use the following
models.

Story of SARS-CoV-2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The spread of misinformation on the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is great. Conspiracy theories rampantly abound. Fanciful ideas that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated as a bioagent for terrorist
applications are not uncommon (ABC News 2020). **SANITISE.media** endeavours to deliver concise and informative reports regarding SARS-CoV-2, to aid public understanding.  
The New York Times published an excellent article about the timeline of the Coronavirus (Wu, Cai & Glanz 2020). In it, they visualised and rendered the estimated spread of the
pandemic during the Luna New Year period in China. **SANITISE.media** finds it critically important to establish an understanding and the timeframe of the pandemic. We were inspired, and aim to
create a similar result as a dedicated *story* page. This would model the spread of pandemic as data-centric as possible, to inform as clearly as possible. 


Data Visualisation 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A clear and effective way to easily be able to communicate large sums of data to the public is using several different visualisation mediums. Such mediums
will involve interactive graphical interfaces (GUIs). For example, maps and drill-down views that can be manipulated by the user. Allowing discovery of further information regarding
their general location (and in the future, medical indicators) in relation to the pandemic. Given the time focussed nature of a pandemic, we also aim to integrate trend views. These would display
time-bound relations and include modelling projections.


Predictions Related to SARS-CoV-2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a team of Data Engineers, we find prediction and modelling core to understanding the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Not only is the modelling not explicit for the average
consumer, but filled with sensationalist headlines only to draw more attention to media corporations. SANITISE.media aims to have interactive and easily accessible
explanations and information about SARS-CoV-2, in hopes this will allow the public to be more informed and help ease the sense of anxiety around SARS-CoV-2, with some form of certainty. 

Project Motivation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This project does not have any stakeholders, rather it is simply a project undertaken independently by university students as part of a subject in order to promote topical data visualisation that is both accuracy and conveys information easily and effectively. The visualisation is currently on a website that is available for free in the public domain.
