The frontend documentation for the SANITISE.media project.

*js:autoclass:: AboutUs*

Note: this function currently can't be "found" by JSDoc. I think it's to
do with the file not meeting JSDoc standards, as everything else works now.

Sphinx error:
No JSDoc documentation was found for object "AboutUs" or any path ending with that.
